    "A knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities—i.e. objects, events, situations, or concepts—and illustrates the relationship between them. This information is usually stored in a graph database and visualized as a graph structure, prompting the term knowledge “graph.”\n",

    "Once the Knowledge Graph (KG) is build, we can use it for many purposes. We can run graph algorithms and calculate centralities of any node, to understand how important a concept (node) is to this body of work. We can calculate communities to bunch the concepts together to better analyse the text. We can understand the connectedness between seemingly disconnected concepts. \n",
